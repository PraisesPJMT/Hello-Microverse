# Hello-Microverse

> In this project, I set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding was used for this exercise. The goal here was to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about in previous steps. I will use them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it was important to know them!.


## Built With

- HTML
- CSS

## Requirements I Observed

- Documented my work in a professional way.
- Created a new GitHub repo.
- Created a new branch according to the GitHub flow rules.
- Added a .gitignore file.
- Set up a linter for HTML and CSS and made sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
- Added this descriptive README file to the project - I use a template but customized it to the project.
- Added 3 files (each one in a separate commit):
    - A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!". Use h1 tag for that.
    - A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header (make it in your favorite color).
    - A test.md file with the text "This file was made to be ignored by git".
- Made sure that the last file is actually ignored by git and is not present in this GitHub repository.
- Opened a pull request.
